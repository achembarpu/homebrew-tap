  caveats <<~EOS
    Zeron can optionally sync workspaces across trusted devices. A synced
    device can read and write the files in workspaces you expose to it.

    Zeron includes an in-app updater; use Homebrew to update this cask when
    you want Homebrew to remain the source of the installed version.
