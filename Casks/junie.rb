  caveats <<~EOS
    Junie ships Developer ID signed and notarized; no re-sign needed. The
    binary linked onto PATH lives inside the app bundle.

    Updates come from `brew upgrade --cask junie`. Junie's built-in
    self-updater expects JetBrains' own shim layout (~/.local/bin/junie),
    which this cask does not install.
