  caveats <<~EOS
    The cask pins the site's current Mac build (1.42c), served from the site's
    Dropbox link, which is still named 1_30d_Mac.zip. Since v1.40a the app
    self-patches offline minor versions in-app, but online-launchable versions
    require a cask update and cannot be upgraded by the auto-patcher.

    The bundled applescript clears quarantine and restores execute bits on the
    app's MacOS binaries; postflight does both of those plus an ad-hoc
    re-sign. On macOS 26 (Tahoe) the non-notarized build may still draw a
    one-time Gatekeeper approval despite the re-sign; that is a
    developer-side limitation, not something the cask can fix.
